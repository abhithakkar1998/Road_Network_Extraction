# Road Network Extraction
This repository implements a road network extraction pipeline using deep learning techniques. 

The pipeline leverages:
- Python as the primary programming language.
- TensorFlow-Keras for building and training the deep learning model.
- OpenCV for image processing tasks.
- The core functionality utilizes a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation of satellite images. This allows the model to identify and extract road pixels, effectively generating a road network representation from the satellite imagery.

Features:
- Semantic segmentation for road network extraction from satellite imagery.
- U-Net architecture for efficient pixel-wise classification.
- Implementation in Python with TensorFlow-Keras and OpenCV.
